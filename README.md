# Scavenger Hunt

That ship looks abandoned, and ripe for pilfering!

Scavenger Hunt is a third person dungeon crawler horror game for the Jogos e Simulação subject at FCT, in the year 2021/2022. A build of the game is available in the [releases](../../releases) page.

## Controls

The game has a built-in tutorial covering the controls, but they will be written here just in case:
* WASD to move
* Aim with the mouse
* Right click to aim
* Left click to shoot
* F toggles your lights

Besides the given controls, the following debug controls are available to aid the professors' evaluation:
* Pressing P pauses the game
* Pressing U toggles free camera movement
* Pressing I toggles framerate count
* Pressing 1 places the camera on the spawn
* Pressing 2 Places the camera on the exit
* Pressing 3 Places the camera on the Hunter
* Pressing 4 Places the camera on the Hunter's target position


## How does the meet the requirements?
Hopefully it's clear, but I'm writing it here just in case:

#### Storytelling
You play Skye Forarger, a scavenger who is looting an seemingly abandoned research vessel.

#### Game Mechanics 
Your basic third person shooter mechanics, collectibles, and a sound system that can alert monsters. Levels are procedurally generated.

#### Aesthetics
Neon Cyan + Pink lights in a futuristic ship.

#### Technology
We have the following off-the-shelf elements:
* Dynamic lights
* Dynamic Shadows
* Environment maps
* Bump maps
* Emission maps
* Unity particle systems
* Animator controllers

#### Custom technology
We have the following custom made technology:
* Procedural content generation
* Multiplayer support using Photon
* Procedural audio generation

## Foreword
This project was unfortunately a bit rushed, and was essentially mostly put together in the span of 5 days with an all-nighter towards the end. This was not due to lack of caring, but rather I personally got very sick for two weeks and was unable to do any work whatsoever, and then by the time that I was feeling better the deadlines for all the projects and tests which I was supposed to have worked on during that time came crashing down. My colleagues were similarly quite busy, so we were left with having to squeeze in as much work as possible in such short time.

Due to the aforementioned crunch, quite a bit of the game was left in a state we weren't particularly happy with, but the resulting game is fully playable and working. We unfortunately had to skimp out on the story, and the multiplayer support was left in a bit of a buggy state.

That being said, it was a fun project and I hope you have fun playing it!
