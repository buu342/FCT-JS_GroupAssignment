It has been 4 days since we depart from that crazy planet. There has been many people sick. I guess the wildlife was really poisenous.
I should be careful. We knows if this is not contagious.

Report from wildlife:
The symbioses present on this planet is enormous, parasites have control over the wildlife and this ecosystem works... strangely...

#Governor *Voice Log*
Captain, i have decided to go to this planet to explore the new wildlife. We heard that there is an animal that regenerates his cells and cures diseases.
This can be huge to the medicine in our home.

#Captain
This man is wrong. Everything about him is wrong. I doubt that he is worried about our medical development. There must be something going on...

#Captain
This is your captain speaking, there has been a breach in our security. Please stay in your rooms and open the door to nobody. 
The disease that entered the ship is very contagious and deadly, we do not know what it can do. Please take care of yourselves.

Feels like i have something growing inside me.
God help me, this hurts so much.

They could not be contained. They are everywhere. There is nothing we can do. We are doomed.

I finally have what i need to achieve the desired imortality, i believe i can finally be the first man we will live forever.

#Governor
I took the sample... Something is not right... They said it was gonna be alright.
